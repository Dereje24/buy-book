# buy-book

## Elevator Pitch: A book selling site for college students where they can easily buy and sell their books.

# 1) Auth 
## Landing page will have:
### A link to a sign up and a login
### Able to see a list of books without being able to buy or post any
### Once logged in, users will be able to CRUD a book
### On the users profile page, there will also be a link to logout

# 2) CRUD
## Once a user is logged in, they will be able to:
### -> Post a book
### -> Edit their post
### -> delete a book they posted 
### -> buy book from other posts
